I have solved two problems, 

Program one is a problem which takes user input based on the behaviour of the car. It allows the user to drive a car based on the input of acceleration, brake, speed , and the odometer rating. The user provides input in the form of  A for acceleration, B for brake, O for odometer reading and S for speed. The output is in the form of sentences like the speed is 5 km etc.

Program two is to find out the percentage of share of each word in a list. It takes a list of strings and checks the percentage share of each word per string list element. The input is a list of strings and the output is the percentage share value of each word for the string element.
